\chapter{Balls-Bins Trails}



\highlightdef{Balls-bins trials are \textit{not independent}}
This is what makes ball-bins trials different from a bernoulli trial.
Each time we remove a ball, we are changing the probability of success for 
the next trial. The probability of success for a given trial is dependent 
on the previous trials. 
So a balls-bin trial is \textit{not} a bernoulli trial.
And a balls-bins process is \textit{not} a bernoulli process.

\section{Counting Successes}

For a $(m,n,r)$-balls bins process, 
\highlightdef{\textbf{No. Successes}: $P(X = k) = \frac{C(r,k) \cdot C(m-r, n-k)}{C(m,n)}$}
