\section{Price-Yield Curve}

Suppose you bought a $10\%$ bond with face value $F = 1000$,
that is compounded biannuality ($m = 2$) for $n = 60$ years. 
Right now we know that a $10\%$ yield has price $\pounds 1000$. 
But what happens to the price if the interest rate increases?


In general, we would like to find a way to relate the price $P$
of a bond to the yield $\lambda$.
