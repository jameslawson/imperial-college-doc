\section{Fast Fourier Transform}

FFT is nothing more than a clever trick for obtaining precisely the same end result as the DFT
When doing theoretical analysis, one uses the DFT rather than the FFT, since the DFT
has an elegant expression as a matrix product.

\highlightdef{$W^N_j = (\omega^N_0,\omega^N_j,\omega^N_{2j},...,\omega^N_{Nj})$}

By this definition, $W$ is a vector of roots of unity arranged to give the
single root, $\omega^N_0$, a \textit{anticlockwise rotational with a certain angular frequency}.
The first element is always $\omega^N_0$. 

\begin{example}
Find $W^5_1$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Find $W^5_2$
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Complete the following $... = [\omega^4_0,\omega^4_2, ... ]$
\end{example}
