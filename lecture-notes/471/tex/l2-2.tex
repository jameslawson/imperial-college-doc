\section{Heap Agreement}


\begin{example}
What is difference between the definition of agreement for $\mathcal{L}_1$ and for $\mathcal{L}_2$?

The way in which an \textit{object on the heap} agrees is different. 
In $\mathcal{L}_1$, an object of class c on the heap must type agree exactly to type c. 
However in $\mathcal{L}_2$, an object of class c on the heap can type agree exactly to any ancestor type c'. 
Apart from the difference, the definitions are the same.
