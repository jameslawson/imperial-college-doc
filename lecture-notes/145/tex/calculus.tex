\section{Independent and Dependent Variables}


Real life examples:
MOSFET IV plots - plot $I_2(V_2,V_3)$
we plot a series of I2-V2 curves, each for a different value of V3. 
Essentially we are taking a variety of V3=constant slices out of the 3d perspective plot,

PVT relationships of gases in thermodynamic.
PV curves for various fixed T (isotherms) and topographic maps of mountains 
where the set of horizontal points at the same altitude are displayed as a curve.)
