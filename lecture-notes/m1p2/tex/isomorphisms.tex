\highlightdef{
$H$ is \textit{normal} iff it is the kernel of a homomorphism
}

\highlightdef{
\textbf{First Isomorphism Theorem}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\text{Im}(\theta)$ is a subgroup of $G_2$
\item $\text{Ker}(\theta)$ is a normal subgroup of $G_1$
\item $G_1/\text{Ker}(\theta)$ is isomorphic to $\text{Im}(\theta)$
\end{enumerate}
}



The moral of this theorem is: 
The best way to show that H is a normal subgroup
of G (and to identify the quotient group) is to Ô¨Ånd a homomorphism from G to another
group whose kernel is H.
