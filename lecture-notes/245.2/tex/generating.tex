\section{Introducing PGFs}

Given a function $f(x)$, we define:
\highlightdef{\textbf{Probability Generating Functions (PGFs)}: $Z\{f(x)\} = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}f(i) z^{i}$}

These are also called moment generating functions (MGFs). 
They are also called \textit{z-transforms} (the \textit{z-transform} of $p$). 

Another definition exists with $Z\{f(x)\} = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{f(i)}{z^{i}}$



\begin{example}
Find the MGF of the binomial distrubtion. Hence find its mean.
