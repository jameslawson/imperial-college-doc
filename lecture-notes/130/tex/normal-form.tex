\section{Project-Join Dependency}


We often decompose relations into \textit{subrelations}. 

A join dependency over attribute set $\alpha$ 
is an expression: $\bowtie[X_1, ..., X_n]$ 
where $\{X_1, ...,  X_n\}$ $\subseteq \alpha$ 
and $\bigcup^{n}_{i=1} X_i = U$.

A relation $R$ over $\alpha$ satisfies a 
join dependency
iff $R = \bowtie^{n}_{j=0} \pi_{X_j}(R)$.

A relation $R$ over $\alpha$ satisfies a 
lossless join with respect to FDs $F$ 
iff for all possible extents of $R$ 
satisfying $S$, we have $R = \bowtie^{n}_{j=0} \pi_{X_j}(R)$. 




Join dependencies that involve $n$ attributes is called an 
$n$-ary project-join dependency. 
2-ary project-join dependencies are a special case. 2-ary prjection-join dependencies 
are called \textit{multivalued dependencies}.
